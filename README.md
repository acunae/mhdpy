# MHD python package

## Installation
1. Make sure you have installed Anaconda3 following the instructions in the [Docs](https://github.com/MHDLab/Documentation/blob/master/README.md), and a Python 3.6 conda environment is selected.
2. Download the Git repository by typing `git clone https://github.com/MHDLab/mhdpy` in Git bash.
3. Open an anaconda prompt as an administrator (type anaconda into the windows search bar and right click to open as administrator).
4. Navigate the prompt to your repository. Copy the local path to your repository and type `cd <repository path>` into the anaconda prompt. Note you have to right click and say paste or use Shift+Insert to insert text in the prompt. 
5. type `conda install .`. 

## Alternative install for development

Alternatively you can install the repository using `conda develop .`. `develop` is similar to `install` but it will allow for you to change and use the mhdpy python package without having to run install again.
