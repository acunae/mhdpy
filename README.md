# MHD python package

## Installation
1. Download the Git repositoy by typing `git clone https://github.com/MHDLab/mhdpy` in Git bash.
2. Open an anaconda prompt as an administrator (type anaconda into the windows search bar and right click to open as administrator). 
3. Navigate the prompt to your repository. Copy the local path to your repository and type `cd <repository path>`. Note you have to right click and say paste or use Shift+Insert in the prompt. 
4. type `python setup.py install`. 

## Alternative install for development

Alternatively you can install the repository using `python setup.py develop`. `develop` is similar to `install` but it will allow for you to change and use the mhdpy python package without having to run install again.  For this method type `python setup.py clean`.  This just cleans temporary setup files in your repository.
